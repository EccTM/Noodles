A Bootstrap 5.1 based startpage made for purpose, not aesthetics.

## Origin
I built this for personal use after checking out a few lovingly crafted startpages that featured giant clocks, animated backgrounds, carousels of artistic photography and responsive search boxes rigged to incorporate more search engines than I previously knew existed.

**All I wanted was a page of links to the websites I actually opened my browser to view.**

## Features
* A screen-load of website icons
* A button to toggle between Light and Dark themes
* It remembers what theme you were using last (per device)
* ~~another clock because you forgot it's already in your taskbar somewhere~~

## Credits
* I *borrowed* the svg icons from [manilarome's squareup startpage](https://github.com/manilarome/squareup) when I was prototyping this and they kinda stuck. Check out that project if you want bells, whistles and a classy looking startpage!
